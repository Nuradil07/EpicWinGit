I am going to leave the Steps for pulling and pushing the codes here !
Do pulling everyDay in the morning before you start working
Do pushing after you done working and when you made changes

Two Main action that you need fro Github
1. How to push your code to Github
    a. git init --> you are going into the Repository
    b. add something to your local
        git add . --> you are adding your changes to staging
    c. git commit -m "your massage"  --> you are committing your local changes
    d. git push --> pushing your local changes to your remote branch(not mater or main branch)
    e. click on URL that appear in  order to create PR (Pull Request)
    NOTE: One of your D2D activities is pulling the updated version of the framework(code) from the GIT version tool that your are using(Github, Bitbucket, Gitlap)

2. How to pull the updated code from GitHub
    a. git stash(if you have uncommitted changes!)
    b. git checkout main/master --> you are now on master/main branch
    c. git pull --> pulling the updated version of the code from remote repo
    d. git checkout your branch "Nurdin" --> switching to your local branch
    e. git merge master/main branch
    f. git unstash your changes
